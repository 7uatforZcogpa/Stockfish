If you are involved in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of processing units and facilities for oil, gas or chemical industries, you may have come across the term Shell Dep 32.37.20.10. But what does it mean and why is it important?
  
Shell Dep 32.37.20.10 is one of the many Design and Engineering Practices (DEPs) published by Shell Global Solutions International B.V. (Shell GSI) and other Shell Service Companies. DEPs reflect the views, at the time of publication, of Shell GSI and other Shell companies on the best practices for designing and engineering processing units and facilities.

DEPs are based on the experience acquired during their involvement with the design, construction, operation and maintenance of processing units and facilities, and they are supplemented with the experience of Group Operating companies. Where appropriate they are based on, or reference is made to, international, regional, national and industry standards.
  
The objective of DEPs is to set the recommended standard for good design and engineering practice applied by Group companies operating an oil refinery, gas handling installation, chemical plant, oil and gas production facility, or any other such facility, and thereby to achieve maximum technical and economic benefit from standardization.
  
Shell Dep 32.37.20.10 specifically covers the topic of instrument signal lines. It provides specifications for the selection, design, installation and testing of instrument signal lines for process control systems, safety instrumented systems (SIS), fire and gas detection systems (FGS) and other instrumentation systems.
  
Instrument signal lines are cables or wires that carry electrical signals between instruments such as sensors, transmitters, controllers, actuators and indicators. They are essential for ensuring accurate measurement and control of process variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level and composition.
  
Shell Dep 32.37.20.10 defines the types of instrument signal lines according to their function, voltage level, signal type and shielding requirements. It also specifies the materials, dimensions, color coding, labeling, routing, termination and grounding of instrument signal lines.
